# How to properly install XinaA15
As stated many times at this point, this is a **IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.** Always use with precaution.

**Precautions & Help:** [**WARNINGS.md**](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/WARNINGS.md) - **Supported Devices/iOS:** [**SUPPORTED.md**](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/blob/main/SUPPORTED.md)

1. Install TrollStore from opa334's GitHub, installation instructions & info can be found there too: [**opa334/TrollStore**](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore)

2. After installing TrollStore, download the XinaA15 IPA from [this GitHub](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15/releases) OR [**jacksight's GitHub**](https://github.com/jacksight/xina520_official_jailbreak/releases)

3. Once downloaded, open the IPA with TrollStore and install the IPA.

4. After the IPA is installed, go to TrollStore settings and tap **Install idid**, this is required to open the XinaA15 app.

5. Once it's fully installed, open the XinaA15 jailbreak and **UN-CHECK SAILY.** DO NOT USE SAILY. **EVER.**

6. After unchecking Saily, tap `openJailbreak` to start the jailbreak process.

7. Your device will most likely reboot, you may want to check the XinaA15 app again to make sure it says "Currently in jailbreak state". If it says that, you are now jailbroken with XinaA15. If it doesn't, try again, it may take a second try.

# Extras after installation
These are things that XinaA15 (as of right now) does not do for you, you must do all of these yourself if you want a full and successful installation of XinaA15.
