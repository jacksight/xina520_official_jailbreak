# AS USUAL, CHECK IF YOUR DEVICE IS SUPPORTED

# BE WARNED, THIS IS A IN-DEVELOPMENT JAILBREAK.

This jailbreak is currently in its **public beta stage** and due to this you **WILL** encounter issues at a certain point of time.

Not only that, but this is a **rootless jailbreak.** Due to the rootless nature of XinaA15, many tweaks will be unsupported and will need an update to support rootless & iOS 15. If you install an untrusted, ancient (not updated), unsupported, or root-only tweak, you may encounter any of the issues below.

**Issues that COULD occur if used incorrectly:**
- [**Device bootlooping**](https://ios.cfw.guide/troubleshooting/#bootloops) → A forever-booting Apple logo.
- [**Respring looping**](https://ios.cfw.guide/troubleshooting/#respring-loops) → A forever-loading spring icon.
- [**Corrupted data**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184) → Forever lost data, photos, documents, and more.

**Please make sure to take the following precautions to prevent any damage on your iPhone device:**
- [**Backup your device.**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) → You can use iTunes on Windows or Finder on macOS to backup your phone.
- [**Save blobs for your device.**](https://ios.cfw.guide/saving-blobs/) → Saving blobs will allow you to downgrade back to a iOS version when needed.
- [**Do not install any dangerous tweaks.**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73033672/211621673-bdaaec4b-9b8e-43e2-8d00-0c2fec1c962c.png) → Downloading dangerous tweaks / stuff from piracy repos may endanger your phone.

All in all, **just use your common sense.**
